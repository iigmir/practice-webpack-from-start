# practice-webpack-from-start

A little project to how webpack works.

## Little notes

* To deal things, webpack need plugins called `loader`.
* `webpack.config.js` is a config file for webapck.
* `html-webpack-plugin` offer HTML settings. You can config HTML here.
    If you want to use your own HTML file, add `template` to HtmlWebpackPlugin.
